# Duolingo_product_design
Designed new KPIs for Duolingo app using Figma.
# KPI 1:
**AI Avatars for scenario wise learning for better context understanding and engagement with app** <br>
How it works:

The user selects a scenario, like “At a Restaurant.” <br>
An AI avatar (e.g., a waiter) starts a conversation: <br>
AI: “Good evening! What can I get for you today?” <br>
User: “I’d like a salad, please.” <br>
The avatar listens, provides corrections, and suggests alternative phrases: <br>
AI: “Great! You can also say, ‘Can I have a salad, please?’” <br>
Users earn points for completing conversations successfully. <br>
