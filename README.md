# Duolingo_product_design
Designed new KPIs for Duolingo app using Figma.
# KPI 1:
**AI Avatars for scenario wise learning for better context understanding and engagement with app**
How it works:

The user selects a scenario, like “At a Restaurant.”
An AI avatar (e.g., a waiter) starts a conversation:
AI: “Good evening! What can I get for you today?”
User: “I’d like a salad, please.”
The avatar listens, provides corrections, and suggests alternative phrases:
AI: “Great! You can also say, ‘Can I have a salad, please?’”
Users earn points for completing conversations successfully.
