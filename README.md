# KPI 1 : Character Learning
**AI Avatars for scenario wise learning for better context understanding and engagement with app** <br>
How it works: <br>
The user selects a scenario, like “At a Restaurant.” <br>
An AI avatar (e.g., a waiter) starts a conversation: <br>
AI: “Good evening! What can I get for you today?” <br>
User: “I’d like a salad, please.” <br>
The avatar listens, provides corrections, and suggests alternative phrases: <br>
AI: “Great! You can also say, ‘Can I have a salad, please?’” <br>
Users earn points for completing conversations successfully. <br>

# KPI 2 : 3D Learning
How it works: <br>
The user clicks the “AR Practice” button, which activates their phone’s camera. <br>
The app scans the area and identifies objects. For example: <br>
A chair gets labeled “Chair” (and its translation: “Silla” in Spanish). <br>
A table gets labeled “Table” (and its translation: “Mesa” in Spanish). <br>
Users tap on the labels to: <br>
Hear the pronunciation. <br>
See example sentences (e.g., “This is a table. The table is round.”). <br>
The app tracks how many new words the user learns during the session. <br>
